# Research Notes: Silicon Valley Startup Culture

## Article 1: Power Dynamics
**Link:** [The VC-Founder Power Dynamic Everyone Denies](https://marshallhargrave.medium.com/the-vc-founder-power-dynamic-everyone-denies-40337c0d5b16)  
**Summary:** This article reveals the unspoken hierarchy and tension between venture capitalists and startup founders. VCs hold disproportionate power over funding, board seats, and company direction, while founders must perform a delicate dance of submission and rebellion. This dynamic directly informs the Orsino‑Olivia‑Cesario triangle: Orsino (the VC) wields financial power over Olivia (the founder), while Cesario (the disguised coder) navigates both worlds as an outsider‑insider.

## Article 2: Attire & Social Performance
**Link:** [Tech bros head to etiquette camp as Silicon Valley levels up its style](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/12/07/tech-startup-founders-etiquette/)  
**Summary:** The piece describes how tech founders are now attending etiquette schools to learn “proper” dress, dining, and social graces—a shift from the traditional hoodie‑and‑jeans uniform. This tension between casual authenticity and cultivated sophistication will shape our costume design. Characters like Sir Toby and Maria will cling to the old “bro‑grammer” aesthetic, while Malvolio will adopt an exaggerated, mismatched version of the new “polished” look, highlighting his social climbing.

## Article 3: Rituals & Cultural Practices
**Link:** [The Monastery Where Founders Meditate on Code and Profit](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-04-15/hf0-startup-accelerator-uses-meditation-to-push-founders)  
**Summary:** This Bloomberg feature explores HF0, a live‑in accelerator that blends monastic meditation with hyper‑capitalist hustle. The ritualized demo days, communal living, and spiritual‑technological jargon provide a perfect analogue for Illyria’s festive, boundary‑dissolving atmosphere. We will stage the play’s revels as hackathons and pitch‑night parties, where characters lose themselves in the collective euphoria of “changing the world.”
