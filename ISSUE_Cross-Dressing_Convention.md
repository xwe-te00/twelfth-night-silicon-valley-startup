## Question for the Production Team

Given our modern setting of a Silicon Valley startup incubator, how do we approach Viola's disguise as "Cesario"? Is it a literal gender swap, or does "Cesario" represent a different kind of "otherness" or "infiltration" within this community's social codes?

## Possible Directions

1. **Literal gender swap:** Viola cuts her hair, wears stereotypical "bro‑grammer" attire (hoodie, jeans, sneakers) and adopts male‑coded mannerisms to navigate the male‑dominated tech world.
2. **Role‑based disguise:** "Cesario" is not about gender but about **role**—Viola poses as a junior developer, a technical co‑founder, or an intern, leveraging the startup's fluid job titles and lack of formal HR.
3. **Digital avatar:** Viola creates a wholly online persona (GitHub profile, LinkedIn, Slack avatar) that presents as male, while her physical appearance remains ambiguous or unchanged.
4. **Cultural infiltration:** "Cesario" is an outsider who learns the jargon, dress code, and rituals well enough to pass, highlighting the performative nature of startup culture itself.

## Dramaturgical & Emotional Consequences

- How does each choice affect the audience's understanding of identity, love, and power?
- Does the disguise reinforce or subvert contemporary gender norms in tech?
- What does it say about the performative aspects of Silicon Valley culture?
